# SAIL Cohort 3 - Group One, **Tech Titans**

This project is developed as part of the SAIL (Senator Abiru Innovative Lab) Cohort 3 program by **Group One**, also known as the **Tech Titans**. The project focuses on building a platform that connects foreigners with **local travel advisors** using React and Progressive Web App (PWA) technology. The goal is to provide a seamless, modern travel advisory service that works efficiently across various devices and network conditions.

## Project Summary

Our platform leverages **React** and **PWA** technology to deliver a fast, responsive, and offline-capable web application. This platform allows foreigners to easily connect with local travel advisors, ensuring a personalized travel experience. The PWA implementation ensures that the app is accessible across devices, with offline capabilities for users who may have limited internet connectivity while traveling.

### Key Features:
- **Local Travel Advisor Connection**: Foreigners can find and connect with local experts to help them navigate unfamiliar destinations.
- **Offline Functionality**: The app supports offline usage, allowing users to access key travel information even without an internet connection.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and intuitive design that makes it simple to find and contact travel advisors.
